# football
Simple python app which can be accessed here:
https://football-production-2a1c.up.railway.app/

The web app is a Python application that uses libraries including Flask & PyTest to highlight key stats from fake performance data. Using GitHub Actions, PyTest runs some basic tests before deploying. For the purposes of the demo I have also deployed as a stateless container using Railway, as this offers observability, monitoring and additional scalability & availability.
Future improvements would see the incorporation of Auth0 for access control, as well as TensorFlow for natural language processing (NLP) which would allow for the data to be queried.
